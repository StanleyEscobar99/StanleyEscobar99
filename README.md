**`Software Engineer`**

I'm currentlyÂ a fellow at a non-profit program "Per Scholas" where I'm enrolled in their software engineering course. I'm a passionate programmer. Most of my projects are currently just work we've been doing in class but they are built from the groundÂ up. I do want to start working on building projects for solving real-life problems.
